## Course Objectives

This course will cover the basics of R and RStudio for beginner users. R is a basic yet powerful tool for data analysis and interpretation that represent a basic tool for any scientist. By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

- confidently use of R, RStudio and its environment
- understand the overall architechture of R, including most of R operators, types of data, main R-objects, and some basic functions
- to import and manipulate data into R
- perform basic data analysis, such as the computation of summary statistics
- visualize data using ggplot2
- perform statistical data analysis, incl. the use and interpretation of linear models and posthoc tests

## Prerequisites

Participants should have basic knowledge of statistics

The course will have a strong component of practical work, supported by brief introductory lectures to each topic. Students are incouraged to bring their own data; there will be the possibility of working on their own data during an "open lab" session scheduled at the end of the course.

## What to bring

- A laptop with a recent version of RStudio installed. Version 3.4 or higher is required to avoid compatibility issues. Please check before the start of the course and update your software if needed. 
- Please also install the following packages: `tidyverse`, `dplyr` (__what else needed?__). Contact us if you encounter problems during installation.

## Course contents

- Introduction to R and RStudio
- Data Structure, importing and quality check
- Basics of data manipulation
- Visualizing data using ggplot2
- Statistical Analyses

The course will consist of a mixture of lectures and tutorial-guided individual coding. Given the short duration of the course you should expect a rather steep learning curve.
